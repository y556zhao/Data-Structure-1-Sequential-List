# Sequential-List-
Brief Intro: 
The sequential list is a way to implement the List ADT that requires a continuous chunk of memory to store data (like array). Since memort locations can be accessed by index, the sequential list allows fast access to data but it needs more operations to insert and delete element. Furthermore, sometimes, it is chanllegeing to determine how much memory to allocate at the run time. The image below is a example of sequential list.

This project includes two parts: the header file with the class declaration and the cpp file. Specifically, for this program, I used dynamic memory allocation. The implementation uses the following variables: Data (a memory location), Capacity (the max number of elements that the list can hold), and Size (the number of inserted elements). The main functions (or methods) include insert function, delete function, select function, and search function. Please refer to the hpp file for more details. 

Hope you enjoy using it!
