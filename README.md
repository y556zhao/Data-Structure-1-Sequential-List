# Sequential-List-
Brief Intro: 
The sequential list is a way to implement the List ADT that requires a continuous chunk of memory to store data (like array). Since memort locations can be accessed by index, the sequential list allows fast access to data but it needs more operations to insert and delete element. Furthermore, sometimes, it is chanllegeing to determine how much memory to allocate at the run time. The image below is a example of sequential list.

This project includes two parts: the header file with the class declaration and the cpp file.
